This project is a visualization of Iridium flares.

IridiumÂ is a constellation of 66 telecommunication satellites orbiting at 7780km.

They feature 3 large flat antennas that may reflect the sunlight towards the observer.

An Iridium flare lasts 10 to 20 seconds and can reach magnitude -9 (brighter than Venus).

Data on flares can be found on heavens-above.com.

In this project, daytime flares are not included.
